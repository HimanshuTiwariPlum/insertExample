Authlogic::ControllerAdapters::RailsAdapter::AuthlogicLoadedTooLateError (Authlogic is trying to prepend a before_filter in ActionController::Base to active itself, the problem is that ApplicationController has already been loaded meaning the before_filter won't get copied into your application. Generally this is due to another gem or plugin requiring your ApplicationController prematurely, such as the resource_controller plugin. The solution is to require Authlogic before these other gems / plugins. Please require authlogic first to get rid of this error.):

Authlogic::ControllerAdapters::RailsAdapter::AuthlogicLoadedTooLateError (Authlogic is trying to prepend a before_filter in ActionController::Base to active itself, the problem is that ApplicationController has already been loaded meaning the before_filter won't get copied into your application. Generally this is due to another gem or plugin requiring your ApplicationController prematurely, such as the resource_controller plugin. The solution is to require Authlogic before these other gems / plugins. Please require authlogic first to get rid of this error.):
